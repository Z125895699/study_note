      <h1>Next.js on Vercel</h1>
      <span
        >Vercel is the native Next.js platform, designed to enhance the
        Next.js experience.</span
      >
      <p>
        Next.js is a fullstack React framework for the web, maintained by
        Vercel.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Next.js works when self-hosting, deploying to Vercel is
        zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for
        <span
            >scalability, availability, and performance globally.</span
          >
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
      <p>There are multiple ways to get started with Next.js on Vercel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you already have a project with Next.js, install Vercel CLI and
          run the vercel command from your project&#39;s root directory
        </li>
        <li>
          Clone one of our Next.js example repos to your favorite git provider
          and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:
        </li>
        <li>Or, choose a template from Vercel&#39;s marketplace:</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span
            >Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to
            generate preview URLs for each pull request you make</span
          >
        to your Next.js project.
      </p>

      <h2 id="incremental-static-regeneration">
        Incremental Static Regeneration
      </h2>
      <p>
        Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to
        <span
            >create or update content without redeploying your site</span
          >. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance,
        improved security, and faster build times.
      </p>
      <p>
        When self-hosting, (ISR) is limited to a single region workload.
        Statically generated pages are not distributed closer to visitors by
        default, without additional configuration or vendoring of a CDN. By
        default, self-hosted ISR does not persist generated pages to durable
        storage. Instead, these files are located in the Next.js cache (which
        expires).
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
            >To enable ISR with Next.js in the app router, add an options
            object with a revalidate property to your fetch requests</span
          >.
      </p>
      <p>To summarize, using ISR with Next.js on Vercel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Better performance with our global Edge Network</li>
        <li>
          Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages
        </li>
        <li>
          Framework-aware infrastructure enables global content updates in
          300ms
        </li>
        <li>
          Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2 id="server-side-rendering-ssr-">Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h2>
      <p>
        Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on
        the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to
        be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or
        looking at the location of an incoming request.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Vercel,
        <span
            >you can server-render Next.js applications in either the Node.js
            runtime (default) with Serverless Functions or the Edge runtime
            with Edge Functions</span
          >. This allows you to pick the best rendering strategy on a per-page
        basis.
      </p>
      <p>To summarize, SSR with Next.js on Vercel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scales to zero when not in use</li>
        <li>Scales automatically with traffic increases</li>
        <li>
          Has zero-configuration support for Cache-Control headers, including
          stale-while-revalidate
        </li>
        <li>
          Framework-aware infrastructure enables switching rendering between
          Edge/Node.js runtimes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="image-optimization">Image Optimization</h2>
      <p>
        Image Optimization helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the
        size of images and using modern image formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        When deploying to Vercel,
        <span>images are automatically optimized on demand</span>, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load
        performance and Core Web Vitals.
      </p>
      <p>
        When self-hosting, Image Optimization uses the default Next.js server
        for optimization. This server manages the rendering of pages and
        serving of static files.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel,
        <span
            >import the next/image component into the component you&#39;d like
            to add an image to</span
          >.
      </p>
      <p>To summarize, using Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero-configuration Image Optimization when using next/image</li>
        <li>Helps your team ensure great performance by default</li>
        <li>
          <span
              >Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand</span
            >
        </li>
        <li>Requires No additional services needed to procure or set up</li>
      </ul>
